# Architecture Overview

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the Pokemon Walkthrough Project, detailing the core design decisions, technology choices, and system interactions that guide the entire application.

## Technology Stack Summary

### Frontend Architecture

- **Core Technologies**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Module System**: ES6+ modules with event-driven communication
- **Component Pattern**: HTML5 semantic elements with data attributes for JavaScript interaction
- **State Management**: Centralized progress management with localStorage persistence

### Development & Deployment

- **Development Tools**: Static server (Python http.server, VS Code Live Server, or optional npm tools)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with static file hosting
- **Future Migration**: Planned migration to React/Vue.js for enhanced maintainability

### Data Architecture

- **Storage Strategy**: localStorage with JSON file fallbacks
- **Data Structure**: Hybrid shared/game-specific model
- **Persistence**: Real-time saving with backup/restore capabilities
- **Cross-Game Integration**: Unified progress tracking across all Pokemon games

## Data Storage Strategy

### Approach

Hybrid structure with shared core data + game-specific overrides

### File Organization

```text
data/
  shared/
    pokemon-base.json     (core Pokemon data: name, type, base stats)
    items-base.json       (core item data: name, description, category)
  games/
    red-pokemon.json      (Red-specific: locations, rarity, evolution methods)
    red-items.json        (Red-specific: item locations, availability)
    red-walkthrough.json  (Red-specific: steps, trainers, story progression)
    blue-pokemon.json     (Blue-specific data with version differences)
    ...
```

### Data Loading Strategy

- Load shared base data once, cache for all games
- Load game-specific data on-demand when user selects a game
- Merge base + game data in JavaScript for complete Pokemon/item objects
- **All base properties can be extended or completely overridden by game-specific data**

### Pokemon Data Challenge

Given the complexity of game-specific Pokemon data, ALL attributes may vary between games:

- Base stats (remakes, balance changes, regional variants)
- Types (regional variants, retcons)
- Evolution methods (generation differences, new mechanics)
- Location and rarity variations
- Move availability and learnsets
- Abilities (introduced in Gen 3, vary by game)

### Override Strategy

Game-specific files can override ANY property from base data, ensuring complete flexibility as we discover edge cases during data population.

**Note**: This structure may need refinement as we populate real game data and discover additional complexity patterns.

### Development Philosophy

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all features
- **Mobile First**: Responsive design optimized for gameplay on-the-go
- **Performance Focused**: Fast loading and smooth interactions
- **Vanilla-First Approach**: Start simple with vanilla technologies, migrate to frameworks later
- **Static Hosting**: No server dependencies, deployable to any static host

## Core Design Patterns

### Module Communication Pattern

The application uses an event-driven architecture to enable loose coupling between modules. This pattern allows components to communicate without direct dependencies, improving maintainability and testability.

**Key Design Decisions:**

- Custom EventEmitter implementation for lightweight, dependency-free messaging
- Global event bus accessible through `window.GameEvents` for cross-module communication
- Error isolation through try-catch in event handlers
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous event handling
- Clear event naming conventions (e.g., `progress:step-completed`, `ui:filter-changed`)

**Implementation Reference:** See [event-system.js](../../examples/architecture/event-system.js) for complete EventEmitter implementation and usage examples.

### Data Structure Patterns

#### Base + Override Pattern

The application manages complex Pokemon data that varies between games using a Base + Override pattern. This design allows for efficient storage of shared data while accommodating game-specific variations.

**Key Design Decisions:**

- Shared base data stored once for all Pokemon (stats, types, names)
- Game-specific overrides provide variations (locations, encounter rates, regional forms)
- Runtime merging creates complete Pokemon objects for specific games
- Deep merge algorithm handles nested property overrides
- Future-proof design accommodates unknown edge cases

**Why This Pattern:**

- Reduces data duplication across games
- Maintains data consistency for shared properties
- Allows complete flexibility for game-specific differences
- Supports both property extensions and complete overrides
- Scales well as more games are added

#### Progress Aggregation Pattern

Cross-game progress tracking requires aggregating data from multiple Pokemon games while maintaining individual game state.

**Key Design Decisions:**

- Each game maintains independent progress state
- Global aggregation computed on-demand from individual games
- Progress tracking includes steps, Pokemon catches, and achievements
- Temporal tracking (timestamps) for progress analytics
- Cross-game Pokemon collection and completion statistics

**Implementation Reference:** See [data-patterns.js](../../examples/architecture/data-patterns.js) for complete Base + Override implementation and progress aggregation examples.

## Component Architecture

### HTML Component Patterns

The application uses semantic HTML5 elements with accessibility-first design and progressive enhancement through data attributes.

**Key Design Decisions:**

- Semantic HTML elements over ARIA roles where possible
- Data attributes for JavaScript interaction points
- Comprehensive labeling for screen readers
- Progressive disclosure using `<details>` elements
- Form-based interaction patterns for keyboard navigation

**Accessibility Features:**

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
- Proper heading hierarchy and landmark structure
- High contrast color schemes and focus indicators
- Screen reader announcements for dynamic content
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements

### CSS Component System

The CSS architecture follows a component-based approach with design tokens and responsive patterns.

**Key Design Decisions:**

- CSS Custom Properties for consistent design tokens
- Component-scoped styling with BEM-like naming
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Generation-based theming system
- Accessibility features built into component styles

**Implementation Reference:**

- See [html-components.html](../../examples/architecture/html-components.html) for semantic HTML component templates
- See [css-components.css](../../examples/architecture/css-components.css) for complete CSS component system

### JavaScript Module Interfaces

The application follows a consistent module interface pattern using inheritance and standardized lifecycle methods.

**Key Design Decisions:**

- BaseManager abstract class provides common interface
- Standardized initialization and cleanup lifecycle
- Event-driven communication between modules
- Dependency injection for testability
- Clear separation of concerns between modules

**Module Responsibilities:**

- **ProgressManager**: Step completion, progress tracking, data persistence
- **UIManager**: DOM manipulation, user interactions, accessibility
- **FilterManager**: Content filtering, search, tag management
- **AccessibilityManager**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation
- **PokedexManager**: Pokemon data, evolution tracking, collection status

**Implementation Reference:** See [module-interfaces.js](../../examples/architecture/module-interfaces.js) for complete BaseManager pattern and concrete implementations.
