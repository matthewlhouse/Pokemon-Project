## Architecture Philosophy

**Core Design Principles:**

- **Mobile-first responsive design**: Optimized for on-the-go gameplay
- **CSS custom properties**: Generation-based theming and consistent color management
- **Component-based organization**: Modular CSS structure for maintainability
- **Accessibility features**: Focus indicators, screen reader support, motion preferences
- **Progressive enhancement**: Visual enhancements layered on accessible foundation

**Implementation Strategy:**

The CSS architecture prioritizes maintainability and scalability through systematic organization and consistent patterns. Each design decision serves the project's goal of creating an accessible, performant Pokemon walkthrough experience.

## CSS File Organization Strategy

**Systematic Structure**: The CSS architecture follows a component-based organization strategy that separates concerns and enables maintainable styling patterns.

**File Organization Philosophy:**

```text
css/
  base/
    reset.css           (normalize/reset styles)
    typography.css      (font definitions, text styles)
    accessibility.css   (focus indicators, screen reader support)

  components/
    steps.css          (step styling, checkboxes, labels)
    locations.css      (collapsible sections, details/summary)
    settings.css       (settings panel, toolbar styling)
    filters.css        (tag filtering, mode switching)

  themes/
    gen1.css          (Red/Blue/Yellow color schemes)
    gen2.css          (Gold/Silver/Crystal color schemes)
    accessibility.css  (high contrast, reduced motion)

  layouts/
    mobile.css        (responsive breakpoints)
    desktop.css       (larger screen optimizations)
```

**Design Rationale**: This structure separates foundational styles from component-specific styling, enables theme switching, and supports responsive design through dedicated layout files.

## Design Token Strategy

The Pokemon Walkthrough Project uses a comprehensive design token system built with CSS custom properties to ensure consistency, enable theming, and support accessibility requirements.

**Core Token Categories:**

- **Color Tokens**: Generation-based Pokemon themes with comprehensive state and accessibility colors
- **Spacing Tokens**: Consistent spacing scale with component-specific spacing patterns
- **Typography Tokens**: Font families, sizes, and line heights optimized for readability
- **Breakpoint Tokens**: Mobile-first responsive design breakpoints

**Design Philosophy:**

- All colors use semantic naming rather than descriptive colors (e.g., `--primary-color` vs `--red-color`)
- Spacing follows a mathematical scale for visual rhythm
- Typography tokens support both web fonts and system font fallbacks
- All tokens consider accessibility requirements and dark mode adaptations

**Implementation Reference:** See [design-tokens.css](../../examples/css/design-tokens.css) for the complete design token system with all color schemes, spacing patterns, typography scales, and accessibility considerations.

## Component Styling Patterns

The component styling system builds on the design tokens to create consistent, maintainable, and accessible interface patterns.

**Core Component Philosophy:**

- **Base + Modifier Pattern**: Components have base styles with modifier classes for states and variations
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Components work without JavaScript and enhance with interactive features
- **Accessibility First**: All components include proper focus indicators and screen reader support
- **State Management**: Clear visual feedback for different interaction and completion states

**Key Component Categories:**

- **Step Components**: Interactive step elements with completion states and category-specific styling
- **Location Sections**: Collapsible location containers with progress indicators
- **Form Elements**: Accessible form controls with proper labeling and error states
- **Filter Elements**: Dynamic content filtering with clear state indication
