3. **Advanced analytics** - Future enhancement
4. **Multiple save slots** - Not needed for MVP
5. **External API integrations** - Future expansion

## üìã Task Dependencies

### Critical Path (Must Complete in Order)

1. **Project Structure** ‚Üí **Data Architecture** ‚Üí **Progress Tracking** ‚Üí **Content Creation**
2. **HTML Foundation** ‚Üí **CSS Styling** ‚Üí **JavaScript Functionality** ‚Üí **Accessibility Testing**
3. **Local Development** ‚Üí **GitHub Pages Setup** ‚Üí **Performance Optimization** ‚Üí **Beta Launch**

### Parallel Development Opportunities

- **Content writing** can happen alongside **feature development**
- **Accessibility testing** should happen with **every feature**
- **Performance optimization** can run parallel to **content creation**
- **Documentation updates** can happen during **development downtime**

## üß™ Testing Strategy for Each Task

### Development Testing Checklist (Apply to Every Task)

- [ ] **Functionality**: Does the feature work as designed?
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Can it be used with keyboard and screen reader?
- [ ] **Performance**: Does it meet our speed targets?
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**: Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge?
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Functions properly on mobile devices?

### Content Testing Checklist (For Walkthrough Content)

- [ ] **Completeness**: All Pokemon/items/battles covered?
- [ ] **Clarity**: Instructions clear for beginners?
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly language?
- [ ] **Version Differences**: Red/Blue/Yellow variations noted?

## üéÆ First Content Target: Pallet Town

### Week 3-4 Goal: Complete Pallet Town Walkthrough

This will serve as our **proof of concept** and **template** for all future content.

#### Content Requirements

- [ ] **Story progression**: Oak's lab, rival encounter, starter selection
- [ ] **Pokemon data**: Starter Pokemon stats, moves, evolution info
- [ ] **Interactive elements**: Progress tracking, choice consequences
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Clear descriptions, logical tab order
- [ ] **Version differences**: Any Red/Blue/Yellow specific content

#### Technical Implementation

- [ ] **HTML structure**: Semantic markup for walkthrough steps
- [ ] **CSS styling**: Visual hierarchy and responsive design
- [ ] **JavaScript functionality**: Step completion, Pokemon tracking
- [ ] **Data integration**: Pokemon data loading and display
- [ ] **Performance**: Fast loading and smooth interactions

## üöÄ Ready to Start?

**Immediate Next Action**: Create the basic project structure and get the first HTML page running locally with VS Code Live Server.

**Success Criteria for Week 1**:

- ‚úÖ Project loads in browser
- ‚úÖ Basic step completion works  
- ‚úÖ Accessible with keyboard navigation
- ‚úÖ Responsive on mobile and desktop
- ‚è≥ Deployed to GitHub Pages (Next step)

**Questions to Address as We Go**:

1. How detailed should Pokemon encounter data be?
2. What's the best way to handle version differences?
3. How can we make content creation efficient?
4. What accessibility features are most important?
5. How should we structure the filtering system?
