# Pending Design Decisions & Testing Requirements

This document tracks features and design decisions that require further testing, discussion, or data collection before final implementation.

## Content Loading Strategy

**Status**: 🟡 **Pending Performance Testing**

**Decision Required**: Choose between upfront loading vs. lazy loading approach

**Testing Needed**:

- [ ] Measure actual data size for complete Gen I content
- [ ] Test Option A (All Upfront) loading time on 4G networks
- [ ] Test Option B (Lazy Loading) user experience with network delays
- [ ] Memory usage testing for 1-2+ hour sessions
- [ ] Battery impact testing on mobile devices

### Option A: All Gen I Data Loaded Upfront

- **Pros**: Instant responsiveness, true offline functionality, simpler architecture
- **Cons**: Larger initial download, slower first load, higher memory usage
- **Performance Impact**: Unknown until data size measured

### Option B: Lazy Loading by Location/Section

- **Pros**: Faster initial load, lower memory footprint, efficient bandwidth
- **Cons**: Loading delays during gameplay, complex offline support, network dependency
- **Performance Impact**: Unknown until user flow testing completed

**User Requirements Context**:

- Players typically play through linearly
- Sessions 1-2+ hours, app may stay open after gameplay ends
- Walkthrough is most critical feature
- Minimum requirement: Walkthrough must work offline
- Content updates will be frequent initially, then taper off

**Next Steps**:

1. Create realistic Gen I dataset for testing
2. Implement both approaches in prototype form
3. Conduct performance testing on target devices
4. User testing with both approaches
5. Make data-driven decision based on results
