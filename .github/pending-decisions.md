## Data Architecture Optimization

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ **Pending Gen I Performance Data**

**Decision Required**: Choose optimal data loading strategy for Pokemon data

**Current Implementation**: Generation-based architecture with single files per data type

- `core/gen1/pokemon.json` (8,121 lines) - Complete Pokemon database
- `core/gen1/moves.json` - Move database
- `core/gen1/items.json` - Item database
- `core/gen1/types.json` - Type effectiveness data

**Testing Needed**:

- [ ] Cache effectiveness and invalidation strategies
- [ ] User experience impact: loading delays vs. responsiveness

### Option A: Keep Current Structure (Recommended for Gen I)

Single file per data type approach

- **Pros**: Simple loading, single source of truth, atomic updates, fewer HTTP requests
- **Cons**: Larger initial downloads, potential edit conflicts, loading time for large files
- **Best for**: Small teams, MVP development, data consistency

### Option B: Modular Data by Category

Split Pokemon data into focused files

```text
core/gen1/pokemon/
â”œâ”€â”€ basic-info.json      # Names, species, types, stats
â”œâ”€â”€ evolution.json       # Evolution chains
â”œâ”€â”€ learnsets.json       # Move learning data
â”œâ”€â”€ tm-compatibility.json # TM/HM compatibility
â””â”€â”€ pokedex-entries.json # Pokedex descriptions
```

- **Pros**: Granular loading, smaller file sizes, team collaboration, targeted updates
- **Cons**: Multiple HTTP requests, coordination overhead, referential integrity challenges
- **Best for**: Large teams, performance optimization, granular updates

### Key Performance Questions to Answer

1. **Loading Overhead vs Loading Time Trade-off**

    - Is 1 large request better than 5 smaller requests?
    - How much does HTTP request overhead impact total load time?
    - What's the network performance impact on different connection types?

2. **User Experience Impact**

    - Do users notice the difference in loading patterns?
    - How does perceived performance compare to actual performance?
    - What's the impact on walkthrough flow and usability?

3. **Development Workflow**
    - How often do we edit different parts of Pokemon data?
    - What's the impact on merge conflicts and collaboration?
    - How does data validation complexity change?

**Evaluation Timeline**:

- **Phase 1**: Complete Gen I with current structure
- **Phase 2**: Collect real performance data from Gen I implementation
- **Phase 3**: Make data-driven decision based on evidence, not speculation

**Success Metrics**:

2. Implement performance monitoring and data collection
3. Gather user feedback on loading experience
4. Conduct A/B testing if performance data suggests benefits
5. Make informed decision based on real-world evidence

### Future Multi-Generation Considerations

**Potential Architecture Evolution**: As additional generations are added, we may need to create shared core files above the generation-specific structure to avoid data duplication.

**Current Structure**:

```text
data/core/gen1/pokemon.json
data/core/gen2/pokemon.json  # When added
data/core/gen3/pokemon.json  # When added
```

**Future Potential Structure**:

```text
data/core/shared/
â”œâ”€â”€ pokemon-universal.json   # Pokemon that exist across generations
â”œâ”€â”€ moves-universal.json     # Moves shared across generations
â””â”€â”€ types-universal.json     # Type system (mostly consistent)
data/core/gen1/
â”œâ”€â”€ pokemon-exclusive.json   # Gen 1 specific Pokemon data
â””â”€â”€ overrides.json          # Gen 1 specific variations
```

**Decision Trigger**: When data duplication across generations becomes significant enough to impact:

- File size and loading performance
- Data consistency maintenance
- Update workflow efficiency

**Evaluation Timeline**: Assess after Gen II implementation to determine actual duplication patterns and maintenance overhead.

## Validation Tool Architecture

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ **Deferred Until Gen II Development**

**Decision Required**: Refactor validation report tooling for maintainability and multi-generation support

**Context**:

- Current `js/validation-report.js` is a large monolithic file (~2000+ lines)
- File contains multiple distinct functional areas that could be modularized
- However, validation tooling is development infrastructure, not user-facing walkthrough code
- Tool will likely need significant changes for each generation anyway

**Current Approach**:

- Accept large monolithic structure for Gen I development phase
- Focus modular architecture efforts on walkthrough application code
- Validation report treated as separate development tool with different architecture standards

**Future Considerations**:

- **Modularization**: Break validation report into focused modules (filtering, charts, quick-fix, virtual scrolling, etc.)
- **Generation Abstraction**: Create generation-agnostic validation framework
- **Tool Chain Integration**: Better integration with development workflow
- **Performance Optimization**: Virtual scrolling and memory management improvements

**Decision Trigger**: Beginning of Gen II development when validation tool modifications become necessary

**Rationale**:

- Validation tool architecture doesn't impact user experience
- Development effort better spent on walkthrough application architecture
- Tool will require substantial changes for Gen II regardless of current structure
- Premature optimization of development tooling vs. user-facing code
