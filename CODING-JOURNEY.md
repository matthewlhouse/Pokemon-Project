- [ ] Create location and route data templates (items, connections, descriptions)

**Learning Objectives:**

- Understand JSON data structure design and normalization
- Practice data organization for scalability and maintainability
- Learn about data validation and integrity constraints
- Design flexible schema for version differences

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Complete Pokemon data schema supports all Generation I content
- [ ] Version differences clearly documented and implementable
- [ ] Data structure supports all planned walkthrough features
- [ ] Schema is validated and can be extended for future generations

**Why This Comes First:**

- ❌ Can't write walkthrough content without knowing data format

- [ ] All interactive elements maintain keyboard accessibility
- [ ] Theme preference persists between browser sessions
- [ ] No JavaScript errors and graceful degradation

### Step 5: Content Creation (AFTER DATA STRUCTURE)

Create the first comprehensive walkthrough content using the established data structure.

**Implementation Goals:**

- [ ] Pallet Town complete walkthrough content
- [ ] Starter Pokemon selection with data integration
- [ ] Version-specific differences documented
- [ ] All encounters, items, and NPCs catalogued

### Step 6: Advanced JavaScript Features (AFTER CONTENT EXISTS)

Add data-dependent functionality once content and data are available.

**Implementation Goals:**
