- 🎯 **Ready for Data & Content Creation** - Pokemon data structure and walkthrough content foundation

### ⏭️ Current Priorities

**Primary Focus:**

1. **Design Pokemon data structure** - JSON schema for Generation I (CRITICAL - blocks all content creation)

**Ongoing Parallel Work:**

1. **Periodic maintenance & cleanup** - Keep project structure clean and well-organized
2. **Implement basic JavaScript features** - Theme switching and UI interactions (no data dependencies)
3. **Create Pallet Town walkthrough content** - First comprehensive content section (after data structure)

## � Completed Phases (Archived)

<details>
<summary>📋 Phase 1: Foundation Implementation (COMPLETED)</summary>

### ✅ HTML Foundation (Week 1)

- ✅ Semantic HTML5 structure with accessibility features
- ✅ ARIA attributes, proper heading hierarchy, keyboard navigation
- ✅ Game selection interface with Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow buttons

### ✅ CSS Architecture (Week 3)  

- ✅ 12-section comprehensive system (614 lines of production-ready code)

## 🚀 Active Development Phase

### Phase 2: Data Structure & Content Creation (CURRENT)

**Primary Objective:** Design and implement Pokemon data structure foundation

**Why This Phase is Critical:**

- 🚫 Cannot create walkthrough content without data format
- 🚫 Cannot implement step tracking without knowing what steps exist  
- 🚫 Cannot build progress indicators without knowing what to measure
- ✅ Basic UI features can be developed in parallel (theme switching, etc.)

#### Current Focus Areas

**1. Pokemon Data Structure Design** ⭐ **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**

**Implementation Goals:**

- [ ] Design JSON schema for Pokemon encounters (levels, rates, locations)
- [ ] Create base data files for Generation I Pokemon (stats, types, moves)
- [ ] Implement version-specific overrides (Red/Blue/Yellow differences)
- [ ] Add trainer battle data structure (names, teams, locations)
- [ ] Create location and route data templates (items, connections, descriptions)

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Complete Pokemon data schema supports all Generation I content
- [ ] Version differences clearly documented and implementable
- [ ] Data structure supports all planned walkthrough features
- [ ] Schema validated and extensible for future generations

**2. Ongoing Maintenance & Organization** 🔄 **PARALLEL WORK**

**Philosophy:** Regular cleanup maintains code quality and developer productivity

**Maintenance Activities:**

- [ ] Periodic file organization and structure review
- [ ] Documentation updates to reflect current project state
- [ ] Code quality checks and validation system improvements
- [ ] Development environment optimization as needed

**3. Basic JavaScript UI Features** 🔄 **PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT**

**No Data Dependencies - Can Start Immediately:**

- [ ] Theme switching system (Red/Blue/Yellow theme toggle)
- [ ] Game selection button states (active/inactive visual feedback)
- [ ] Settings panel toggle functionality
- [ ] Basic keyboard navigation enhancements
- [ ] localStorage for theme preference

## � Next Steps & Timeline

### Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 Weeks)

1. **Data Structure Design** - Create comprehensive JSON schema
2. **Basic JavaScript Implementation** - Theme switching and UI interactions
3. **Content Planning** - Prepare Pallet Town walkthrough structure

### Following Phase (After Data Structure)

1. **Content Creation** - First comprehensive walkthrough content
2. **Data Integration** - Connect content to data structure
3. **Advanced JavaScript** - Step tracking and progress features

## 🎮 Ready to Continue Your Journey?

**Current Status:** Clean, optimized development environment ready for data structure design

**Next Challenge:** Design the Pokemon data structure JSON schema that will support all Generation I walkthrough content

**Maintenance Philosophy:** Regular cleanup and organization ensures sustainable development
