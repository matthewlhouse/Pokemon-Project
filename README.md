# Pokemon Walkthrough Project

Interactive, accessible Pokemon game walkthroughs for Red, Blue, and Yellow versions with progress tracking and customizable viewing options.

## 🎮 Current Status

**Development Phase**: Foundation Setup (Week 1)  
**Current Focus**: Basic project structure and core functionality  
**Target**: Generation I MVP (Pokemon Red, Blue, Yellow)

## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

### Prerequisites

- **Git** - For version control
- **VS Code** - Recommended editor with Live Server extension
- **Modern Browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge

### Running Locally

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the project folder in VS Code
3. Install the **Live Server** extension if you haven't already
4. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"
5. The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:5500`

### Development Tools

We use VS Code extensions instead of npm build tools for simplicity:

- **Live Server** - Development server with auto-refresh
- **HTML Validator** - Catch HTML errors during development
- **axe Accessibility Linter** - Real-time accessibility feedback
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **ESLint** - JavaScript linting
